        <p><strong>The coronavirus has tragically claimed the lives of over 16,000 New York City residents</strong>. Communities of color have seen higher case and mortality rates during the pandemic. In July, The UN defined urban areas as epicenters
          of the pandemic saying, "for many cities, the COVID-19 health crisis has expanded to a crisis of urban access, urban equity, urban finance, safety, joblessness, public services, infrastructure and transport, all of which are
          disproportionally affecting the most vulnerable in society." </p>

        According to the AMP Research Lab, the mortality rate for Latinos is higher than any other group across the United States, despite Latino’s only making up 18% of the United States’ population. In New York, the death rate for Hispanic people
        in the city is about 268 people per 100,000; for African Americans in New York the Death rate is around 249 people per 100,000.

      <p> Emilio Morante, an urban planner and researcher whose focus is in epidemiology, says that lack of acess to healthcare and econmoic status is related to the higher COVID-19 case and mortality rates. “Minority communities are by
        definition, not only poorer, but they're more stressed out. You can anticipate that they're going to need healthcare,” said Emilio Morante, an urban planner and researcher whose focus is in epidemiology.“COVID
        has compromised the economy. People of color worked in restaurants, stock supermarket shelves and are finding themselves vulnerable and unemployed, especially now with the virus surging. It's a multiple impact.”</p>
